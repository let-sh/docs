## Create a Nuxt.js project

Nuxt.js support is a built-in feature.
You can follow the instructions in [Nuxt.js Get Started](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation)
to create a Nuxt.js project.

## Deploy to let.sh

Once you have completed the [Nuxt.js Get Started](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation)
instructions, you can use let.sh to complete the deployment with a single command:

> if you haven't install `lets`, please take a look at the documentation: [Cli Overview](/cli/overview).

```shell
lets deploy
```

Then you can visit the given URL and see your Nuxt.js project showing a "Hello World!".
