## Start development with a single command line

```shell
lets dev
```

After running lets dev in your current directory, let.sh will detect your current framework and start your your app in localhost. You can change the running command in the first time start your dev env, or run `lets dev` with your custom running command.

Once your service is running in the localhost, let.sh will detect the bind port of your running service, and expose your service to the internet with a public url. Then you could share this url with others to view your great works.
