## What is [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)?

according to [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), Lighthouse is a tool that helps you evaluate the performance of your web pages.

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

### Performance

Audits for metrics like first paint and time to interactive to determine lag.

### Accessibility

Checks for common issues that may prevent users from accessing your content.

### Best Practices

Looks for everything from HTTPS usage to correct image aspect ratios.

### Largest Contentful Paint

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is an important, user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded—a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful.

### Cumulative Layout Shift

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.

### Total Blocking Time

Total Blocking Time (TBT) is one of the metrics tracked in the Performance section of the Lighthouse report. Each metric captures some aspect of page load speed.
