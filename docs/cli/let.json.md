### rewrites

::: warning
Rewrite is an advanced feature that you may not need to use.
Most time you just need to use your favorite frameworks
and everything will work fine, with let.sh.
:::

Rewrite means you request will be modified internally
and then continue to be processed.
The rewrite directive implies the intent to accept the request,
but with some modifications.

You can add one or more mutually exclusive rewrite directives,
if your request match one of the rewrite directive,
the path will be modified with the given one, and then continue to be processed.

As you can see in [Demo let.json](/cli/let.json#demo-letjson) section,
every rewrite directive has a `source` and a `destination` field.
The `source` field accept a wildcard pattern, as referenced in [Caddy Matchers](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/matchers),
the `destination` field is a path where your request will be rewrite to.

### redirects

::: warning
Rewrite is an advanced feature that you may not need to use.
Most time you just need to use your favorite frameworks
and everything will work fine, with let.sh.
:::

most time it is [301 Moved Permanently](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301)
or [302 Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302).

You can add one or more mutually exclusive redirect directives,
if your request match one of the redirect directive,
a standard HTTP redirect will be reponsed, fellowing your configuration.

As you can see in [Demo let.json](/cli/let.json#demo-letjson) section,
every redirect directive has a `source`, a `destination` field and a `type` field.
The `source` field accept a wildcard pattern, as referenced in [Caddy Matchers](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/matchers),
the `destination` field is a path where your request will be redirect to,
and the `type` field specifies the HTTP status code of the reponse.
