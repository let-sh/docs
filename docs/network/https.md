## Automate https for all sites

let.sh provide automatically certificates for all sites. As long as you deploy or link and domain to let.sh projects, our scheduler will automatically sign certificates via [let's encrpyt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

## HTTP/2 support

let.sh provides http/2 support for all sites, a newer internet protocol engineered for faster web performance.

## HTTP/3(QUIC) support

currently we are providing limited support for HTTP/3(QUIC) support.

## TLS

Currently let.sh enables tls1.2 and tls 1.3. And tls1.0 and tls1.1 is deprecated via IETF guidelines <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8996/>
